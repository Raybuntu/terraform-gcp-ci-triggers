# Cloud Build Trigger for Automated Packer Builds

This project provisions all necessary Google Cloud resources to establish a Cloud Build trigger that initiates an automated build process for a Packer repository on every push to the main branch in GitHub. The solution ensures secure integration between Google Cloud Build and GitHub using a GitHub App installation and manages all permissions required for build operations.

## Purpose

The Terraform configuration in this repository creates and configures the following:
- Service accounts and required IAM roles for Cloud Build and Packer operations (IAM Module)
- Secure access to secrets required for authentication with GitHub (Cloudbuild Module)
- Cloud Build V2 connection to GitHub using a GitHub App installation (Cloudbuild Module)
- Registration of the Packer repository with Cloud Build (Cloudbuild Module)
- Registration of the Webapp repository with Cloud Build (Cloudbuild Module)
- Cloud Build trigger that runs on pushes to the main packer image branch (Cloudbuild Module)
- Cloud Build trigger that runs on pushes to the main webapp branch (Cloudbuild Module)

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following:
- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- A GitHub repository intended for Packer builds
- A GitHub App installed in your organization and its installation ID available
- A secret in Google Secret Manager containing the GitHub OAuth token for Cloud Build

## Required Variables

Define the following variables in your `terraform.tfvars` or as environment variables:

| Variable                     | Description                                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project_id`                 | The GCP project ID where resources are created                      |
| `connection_name`            | Name for the Cloud Build GitHub connection                          |
| `packer_remote_uri`          | HTTPS URI of the Packer GitHub repository                           |
| `webapp_remote_uri`          | HTTPS URI of the webapp repository (used in substitutions)          |
| `webapp_git_sha`             | Git commit SHA for the webapp repository                            |
| `build_region`               | GCP region for Cloud Build resources                                |
| `build_zone`                 | GCP zone used in build substitutions (Packer builds)                |
| `github_app_installation_id` | The GitHub App installation ID                                      |
| `gh_connect_secret_id`       | Secret Manager secret ID for GitHub OAuth token                     |
| `gh_connect_secret_name`     | Name of the Secret Manager secret containing the OAuth token        |

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Define all required variables in a `terraform.tfvars` file.
3. Initialize Terraform:

   ```
   terraform init -backend-config=backend.tfbackend
   ```

4. Review the execution plan:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the configuration:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

After successful deployment, every push to the `main` branch of the specified Packer GitHub repository will trigger a Cloud Build process in your GCP project.

## Notes

- Ensure that the GitHub App has sufficient permissions on the repository and that the OAuth token stored in Secret Manager is valid.
- Adjust IAM roles and permissions as required to comply with your organizationâ€™s security policies.
- The configuration assumes use of Google Cloud Build V2 and GitHub App-based authentication.

## Utility Scripts

### scripts/cleanup_images.sh

This script manages Google Compute Engine images by retaining only the latest image in a specified image family and deleting all older images. This helps prevent unnecessary disk usage and clutter from outdated images.

**Functionality:**
- Identifies the latest image in the configured image family for the project.
- Lists all other images belonging to the family.
- Deletes each image that is not the latest.

**Usage:**
```
bash scripts/cleanup_images.sh
```
Modify the `FAMILY` and `PROJECT` variables in the script to match your environment if needed.

---

### scripts/set_gcp_credentials.sh

This script sets up a temporary Google Cloud credentials file by retrieving a service account key from a password manager using the `pass` utility. The temporary credentials file is automatically deleted when the session ends.

**Functionality:**
- Creates a temporary file for the service account credentials.
- Reads the key from the password manager and writes it to the file.
- Sets file permissions to restrict access.
- Registers a cleanup step to remove the file upon session exit.

**Usage:**
```
source scripts/set_gcp_credentials.sh
```
This command exports the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for your shell session. Ensure you have the password manager set up and the appropriate secret stored.
